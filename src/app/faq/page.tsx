    questions: [
      {
        q: "What is cryptocurrency?",
        a: "Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks using blockchain technology.",

      {
        q: "What is blockchain technology?",
        a: "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers in a way that makes the records difficult to alter. Each 'block' contains transaction data and is linked to the previous block, forming a 'chain' of transparent, immutable records.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is cryptocurrency safe to invest in?",
        a: "Cryptocurrency investments carry significant risks including volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and security concerns. We encourage thorough research and education before investing.

    questions: [
      {
        q: "What is ADA?",

      },
      {
        q: "How do I stake my ADA?",
        a: "Staking ADA involves delegating your tokens to a stake pool, which helps secure the network while earning you rewards. You maintain full control of your ADA—it never leaves your wallet. We offer comprehensive guides on how to stake through our Cardano Hub.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is Project Catalyst?",
        a: "Project Catalyst is Cardano's community-driven innovation fund. ADA holders can submit proposals for projects, vote on proposals, and help guide the development of the Cardano ecosystem. It's one of the largest decentralized innovation funds in the world.",
